# EvenFibonacciNumber
A Csharp program to find the sum of all even numbers below 4000000
it returns 4613732

Explanation

1: Initialize the first and second terms and set them both to zero

2: initialize the sum variable and set it to zero

3: Calculate the Fibonacci numbers and sum up the even numbers

  3.1: Store the value of second term in a temp variable since it will be mutated

  3.2: Change the second term to be the sum of fisrt term and second term

  3.3: Set the First term to be the temp variable

  3.4: find the even numbers in the fib sequence and add them to the sum variable
